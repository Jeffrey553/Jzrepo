## About Me

I am a cybersecurity intern transitioning into a full-fledged cybersecurity engineer role. He has a rich background in various technical and security-focused tasks, evolving from a Desktop Support Analyst to managing complex projects related to API integrations, security incident responses, and monitoring solutions. Jeffrey's expertise spans across multiple tools and platforms, including Datadog, CrowdStrike, AWS, Jamf, and more.

### Key Projects and Responsibilities

1. **iPad Deployment for Mobile Applications**
   - Utilized zero-touch deployment and Jamf for managing iPad deployments.
   - Implemented AppConfig with CrowdStrike Falcon for MDM.
   - Verified successful deployments and device visibility on the Falcon console.

2. **API Integrations and Metrics Automation**
   - Worked on projects to hit different API endpoints and automate key metrics.
   - Integrated various data sources with Datadog to update dashboards for security operations.

3. **Security Dashboards and KPI Tracking**
   - Updated Dashboards in Datadog to display metrics for Security Team KPIs and Threat Metrics.
   - Created dashboards to monitor security risk states of devices using Jamf Radar API.
   - Focused on top metrics: Total Alerts, MTTD, MTTR, False Positives, and Stops.

4. **Alerting and Monitoring**
   - Configured Datadog notifications to a dedicated Slack alerting channel.
   - Developed new and improved alerts and playbooks for various security incidents.
   - Implemented brute force detection monitors and created playbooks for response.

5. **CrowdStrike API Scripting**
   - Developed scripts for managing hosts, host groups, and retrieving IOA/IoM events.
   - Ensured pagination and accurate data retrieval for large datasets.
   - Focused on filtering and extracting specific security events.

6. **Security Incident Response**
   - Addressed security alerts such as rapid geolocation changes and performed brute force testing to enhance monitoring capabilities.
   - Used the Datadog API to list and manage detection rules.

7. **Internal Tool and Workflow Development**
   - Created custom scripts and workflows to streamline security operations.
   - Engaged in projects to simulate attacks and improve the security posture through red and blue team activities.
   - Developed case management integration for automated incident tracking.

### Tools and Technologies
